___

# Step 1: Fork this repository
- The URL of my forked repository

# Step 2: Clone your forked repository from the command line
- My GraphQL response from adding myself as an account on the test project
```
{
  "data": {
    "mutateAccount": {
      "id": "5f0b14dd-e034-4ac6-8786-74e7fa987575",
      "name": "Jonathan Gaston",
      "email": "JG1579"
    }
  }
}
```

# Step 3: Signup for and configure New Relic
- The chosen name of your New Relic ```app_name``` configuration
```
app_name: ['<cisLAb5>']
```

# Step 4: Exercising the application / generating performance data

_Note: No lab notes required._

# Step 5: Explore your performance data
* Enter you computer's health

* What are your observations regarding the performance of this application? 
  >  The average response time is 407.83 ms throughout the searches. The longest was 1864.225 ms during number 6. The average error rate was 4.29%. My average throughput was 4.67rpm.
* Is performance even or uneven? 
  > For the most part the queries took up a consistently quick amount of time. Except for 1 and 6 which took up considerably  more time. Number 7 didn't start up and jst returned errors.
* Between queries and mutations, what requests are less performant? 
  > The queries were the least preformat and consistently took up the most time.
* Among the less performant requests, which ones are the most problematic?
  > Number 7 is the most problematic solely because it gave back no useful information. Number 6 is a runner-up because it took enough time that users may become frustrated or annoyed.

# Step 6: Diagnosing an issue based on telemetry data
* Within the transactions you're examining, what segment(s) took the most time?
  > The segment "queryOrdersBySearchTerm" consistently took up the most time. It on average took up 83.7% of the overall time per transaction. 
* Using New Relic, identify and record the least performant request(s).
  > The least performant requests were the query's
* Using the Transaction Trace capability in New Relic, identify which segment(s) in that request permeation is/are the most problematic and record your findings.
  > The segment "queryOrdersBySearchTerm" was the least efficient by an incredibly large margin.
* Recommend a solution for improving the performance of those most problematic request(s) / permeation(s).
  > The best way to improve performance is to limit the query's pool which will also limit the query's output. It also may be best to have the query use certain categories to also help improve speed.

# Step 7: Submitting a Pull Request
_Note: No lab notes required._

# Step 8: [EXTRA CREDIT] Address the performance issue(s)
For the purposes of gaining 25% extra credit on the assignment, perform any of the following:
1. Adjust the diagnosed slow call(s) to improve performance. 
2. Verify the improved performance in New Relic, **including data and/or screenshots in your lab report**.
2. Check in those changes and **note your solution(s)** in your lab report.
